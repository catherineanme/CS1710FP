Abstract 

This project analyzes Namibia’s electoral landscape using two complementary datasets that together span geographic, temporal, and party-level political information. The first dataset, an Excel file of national results, summarizes vote totals and trends for the 2019 National Assembly election. The second dataset, a large GeoJSON file, contains detailed regional and constituency-level voting data for both 2014 and 2019, paired with polygon geometries used for spatial visualizations. These datasets were obtained from the  Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN)  and are publicly available with no usage restrictions. After cleaning and transformations, they power all interactive maps, charts, and analyses in our final web-based data story.

1. Overview of Data Sources 

   Files Included 

    1.  namibia_election_results.xlsx 

   * Size:  6 KB 
   * Type: Excel spreadsheet
   * Scope: *National-level* party results (2019 National Assembly)

    2.  namibia.geojson 

   * Size:  6.5 MB 
   * Type: GeoJSON
   * Scope: *Constituency- and region-level* results for 2014 & 2019, with complete geographic shapes.

Both datasets were generated by the  Namibian government  (Electoral Commission of Namibia) and made publicly available. The GeoJSON layer was constructed from publicly released administrative boundaries paired with election result tables.
There are  no usage restrictions .

2. Dataset: namibia_election_results.xlsx 

Sheet Used:  *National Assembly Results (2019)*

This dataset is a national-level summary of the 2019 National Assembly election. It was used to build the introductory narrative visualization showing vote totals and support trends.

| % SUPPORT | Vote share (0–1 decimal representation)                 | float   |
| TREND     | Change in vote share relative to prior election (↑ / ↓) | string  |

Cleaning Steps 

* Removed header artifact (“NATIONAL ASSEMBLY – NATIONAL”).
* Converted percentage fields to floats.
* Removed commas and ensured VOTES stored as integers.
* Standardized party names to match GeoJSON party labels.

5. Statistical Exploration & Findings (from Milestone 5) 

  Dataset Summary 

*  Total Records:  5,072
*  Years Covered:  2014, 2019
*  Constituencies:  125
*  Regions:  14
*  Parties:  30
*  Election Types:  National Assembly, Presidential

 Key Issues Identified 

1.  Turnout > 100% in 180 records (3.5%) 

   * Example: Windhoek East turnout = 138%
   * Possible causes: same-day registration, data entry inconsistencies
2.  Zero votes in 48 records 

   * Could be legitimate or a reporting quirk

  No Missing Values 

All 5,072 records have complete data across 17 columns.

   Outlier Examples 

* Highest vote totals:

  * SWAPO in Outapi (17,965 in 2014; 15,330 in 2019)
* Turnout extremes:

  * Min 29.37%, Max 138.47%

   Distribution Observations 

* Vote counts are highly skewed:

  * Mean = 499 votes per party-unit
  * Median = 37 votes
* Turnout mean = 67%
* Presidential candidates treated as “parties” in 2019 dataset

----------------

6. Cleaning & Transformation Summary 

  High-Priority Fixes 

* Document turnout >100% anomaly
* Standardize party names across both datasets
* Filter election type when needed

  Derived Variables Created 

* vote_share = votes ÷ total_votes
* turnout_adjusted = min(turnout_reg, 1.0)
* geometry_level flags for region vs. constituency visualization
* Encoded year, region, and constituency for efficient JavaScript handling

GeoJSON Cleaning 

* Validated multipolygons for D3
* Resolved naming inconsistencies
* Ensured coordinate consistency

----------------

7. How the Data Is Used in the Visualization 

   Excel 

* National-level election overview
* Party vote totals & trend indicators
* Introductory bar charts & summaries

   GeoJSON 

Supports:

* Choropleth maps (vote share, turnout, fragmentation)
* Comparison maps (2014 vs. 2019 vote shifts)
* Competitiveness heatmaps
* Scenario modeling (fragmented vs. coordinated opposition)
* All hover interactions, highlighting, zooming, and region-level deep dives

----------------

8. Limitations 

* Dataset lacks demographic information (ethnicity, income, age).
* Cannot directly analyze socioeconomic drivers of voting behavior.
